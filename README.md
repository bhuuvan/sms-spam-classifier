# Spam Classification Using Machine Learning

This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning project that classifies messages as either spam or ham using various techniques and algorithms. Here's a breakdown of the project's steps:

## Dataset
- The dataset (`spam.csv`) contains a collection of SMS messages labeled as 'spam' or 'ham'.

## Project Outline
1. **Data Cleaning**: 
    - Dropped unnecessary columns.
    - Renamed columns for better understanding.
    - Encoded target labels using `LabelEncoder`.
    - Removed duplicate entries.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - Checked basic statistics.
    - Visualized data distribution.
    - Analyzed the length of messages in terms of characters, words, and sentences.

3. **Text Preprocessing**:
    - Converted text to lowercase.
    - Tokenized text.
    - Removed special characters, stopwords, and punctuation.
    - Applied stemming using the Porter Stemmer.

4. **Feature Extraction**:
    - Utilized TF-IDF Vectorizer to convert text into a numerical format suitable for machine learning models.

5. **Model Building**:
    - Tested various classification algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and more.
    - Evaluated models based on accuracy and precision.

6. **Model Evaluation**:
    - Chose the TF-IDF Vectorizer and Multinomial Naive Bayes as the final model due to its performance metrics.
    - Saved the final model (`model.pkl`) and the vectorizer (`vectorizer.pkl`) using pickle.

## Files Description:
- `spam.csv`: Dataset containing SMS messages.
- `README.md`: This document explaining the project.
- `model.pkl`: Pickle file containing the trained Multinomial Naive Bayes model.
- `vectorizer.pkl`: Pickle file containing the TF-IDF Vectorizer.

## Instructions to Run:
1. Ensure you have all necessary libraries installed (`numpy`, `pandas`, `nltk`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `wordcloud`, `xgboost`).
2. Clone this repository.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to execute the entire pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
